# Welcome to Lendo App

This project has been gracefully initiated with the help of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a fantastic tool that provides a solid foundation for building React applications. Additionally, it proudly incorporates the powerful [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) as its CSS frameworks, elegantly enhancing the visual appeal and responsiveness of the user interface. To ensure streamlined development and customization, the project employs the preprocessor SCSS. For the inclusion of captivating and expressive icons, the renowned library [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) has been thoughtfully integrated. The combination of these remarkable technologies ensures an exceptional user experience and a polished, aesthetically pleasing design.
